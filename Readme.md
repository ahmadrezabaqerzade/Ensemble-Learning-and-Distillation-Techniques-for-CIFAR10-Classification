<h1>Increasing accuracy on dataset CIFAR10 using three techniques:</h1>
<h2>In this project, I will train the CIFAR10 dataset using three methods: </h2>
<h3>1.Self Distillation:</h3> <h4>Improvement in accuracy by approximately 2.2 percent</h4>

<h3>2.Knowledge Distillation:</h3> <h4> Improvement in accuracy by approximately 2 percent.</h3>

<h3>3.Ensemble Learning:</h3> <h4> Improvement in accuracy by approximately 2.7 percent.</h3> 

<h5>The aim is to increase accuracy at each stage with each of these methods.</h5>
