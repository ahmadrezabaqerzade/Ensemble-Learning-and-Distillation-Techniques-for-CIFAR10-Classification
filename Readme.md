<h1>Increasing accuracy on dataset CIFAR10 using three techniques:</h1>
In this project, I will train the CIFAR10 dataset using three methods: 
<h3>1.self-distillation: Improvement in accuracy by approximately 2.2 percent</h3>

<h3>2.knowledge distillation: Improvement in accuracy by approximately 2 percent.</h3>

<h3>3.ensemble learning: Improvement in accuracy by approximately 2.7 percent.</h3> 

The aim is to increase accuracy at each stage with each of these methods.
