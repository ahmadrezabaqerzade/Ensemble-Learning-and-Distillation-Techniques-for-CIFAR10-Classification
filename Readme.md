<h1>Increasing accuracy on dataset CIFAR10 using three techniques:</h1>
In this project, I will train the CIFAR10 dataset using three methods: 
1.self-distillation: Improvement in accuracy by approximately 2.2 percent
2.knowledge distillation: Improvement in accuracy by approximately 2 percent.
3.ensemble learning: Improvement in accuracy by approximately 2.7 percent. 

The aim is to increase accuracy at each stage with each of these methods.
